ps. you'll need to create an alpaca markets api key (it's free, and surprisingly simple to do...) and then create a config.json file that looks like:

{
"ALPACA_KEY": "get your own",
"ALPACA_SECRET": "haha u thought"
}


and pps. only the 30MinBarAttributes works... i was too lazy to segment it further to 5 and 15 min lmfao
